## GuildContribParser

An addon which parses each guild member's contribution and saves to a json file.


### Usage:
Go to the guild tower and open the guild growth interface. Type `/guildcontrib` in chatbox. The result is saved to `"[$TreeOfSavior_Folder]\addons\guildcontribparser\contrib.json`.

You need to manually create the folder `"[$TreeOfSavior_Folder]\addons\guildcontribparser` *before first usage*.
